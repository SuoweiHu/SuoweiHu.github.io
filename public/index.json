After some research, I found this issue could be potentially related to a version mis-match of the composer and the drupal 8 (reference: link), the composer in the project could be of version 1.XX, and the local instance is using version 2.XX \u0026hellip;\nFailed Attempt I quickly went online and found this solution: link, that uses the following command to upgrade/downgrade composer:\n1 2 3 4 # Down-grade to composer 1 sudo composer self-update --1; sudo apt-mark hold sp-composer; # Up-grade to composer 2 sudo apt-mark unhold sp-composer; sudo composer self-update --2 But this one only updates the composer version globally, and it does not solve the issue of installing drush on the current working directory. (I am using MAMP as my web server, and as a result, I will need to update the version of the composer located at /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/composer)\nWorking Solution In order to upgrade the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; composer, I did the following:\nFirst, getting one composer 1.10 version phar file from this site: link. Place it on some location you can found, here I am putting it at my MAMP directory/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/composer.phar.\n(Note: in order to run this file, you will either need to use box command to compile it (box compile composer.php), or use php as the interpreter to run it (php composer.php), Since here we are only using it temporarily, we will use the shortcut of php: `php /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/composer.phar \u0026ndash;version )\nSecond, I will need to find the correct compatible version of drush via the official website, for my instance drush/drush:10\nThird, running the require command to install: php /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/composer.phar require drush/drush:10\nLastly, (OPTIONAL) If the memory is not sufficient during the composer install/update you might see something ilke this: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 1610612736 bytes exhausted .\nIn order to change the memory limit you will need to add a parameter -d memory_limit=-1 , the command comes together looks like: php -d memory_limit=-1 /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/composer.phar require drush/drush:10\nAs a result you should see the downloaded instance of composer installing drush successfully:\n","permalink":"https://blog.simon-hu.org/posts/2023.11.10-install-drush-on-drupal-8-and-composer-1/","summary":"Intuition I was recently working on a client site, and I got to the issue where the site will show \u0026ldquo;Page unavailable\u0026rdquo; upon login.

As a developer you might be aware of API\u0026rsquo;s, and the legitimate banking website is using exactly that to transfer money from account to account, for instance: \u0026ldquo;https://bank-site-a.com/api?from=account1\u0026amp;to=account2\u0026rdquo;. If without any security policy, the phishing site B can copy this exact link and place it on some easily found buttons or links, and once a user (with logged in bank account) clicks on these buttons or links, the transaction will be triggered without the user\u0026rsquo;s permission.\nSuch attack forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated, is called Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\nAnd the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy is here to prevent this ! It will allow controlled access to resources from different origins/domain names in web browsers, ensuring security and protecting against cross-site scripting attacks.\nExample CORS Request Type ? The CORS request will be preflighted (preflight request sent) in the following cases:\n1 2 3 - Non-simple request methods: If the request method is other than GET, POST, or HEAD, a preflight request is sent. - Custom request headers: If the request includes custom headers (apart from a few allowed headers like `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`, `Content-Type`, etc.), a preflight request is sent. - Content-Type header: If the ﻿Content-Type header value is outside the allowed values for simple requests, a preflight request is sent. For all other cases, the request is considered a simple request, and no preflight request is needed\nCORS Simple Request Suppose a user visits http://www.example.com and the page attempts a cross-origin request to fetch data from http://service.example.com. A CORS-compatible browser will attempt to make a cross-origin request to service.example.com as follows.\nThe browser ends request with Origin header to service.example.com: 1 Origin: http://www.example.com The server at service.example.com sends one of these three responses: 1 2 3 A) wild-card: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * B) with-origin: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com C) disallow: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: none CORS Preflight Request When performing certain types of cross-domain Ajax requests, modern browsers that support CORS will initiate an extra \u0026ldquo;preflight\u0026rdquo; request to determine whether they have permission to perform the action. Cross-origin requests are preflighted this way because they may have implications to user data.\n1 2 3 4 OPTIONS / Host: service.example.com Origin: http://www.example.com Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT If service.example.com is willing to accept the action, it may respond with the following headers:\n1 2 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT The browser will then make the actual request. If service.example.com does not accept cross-site requests from this origin then it will respond with error to the OPTIONS request and the browser will not make the actual request.\nResolving Cross-Origin Issue From time to time we will have to face the condition where we need to access some portion of the site from another site (for instance: reading font-face or script, fetching data using ajax), and in that scenario, we will need to bypass the Cross-Origin constraint by CORS policy. And we can resolve this via two methods: making the two sites under the same domain (using reverse proxy like apache or nginx), or add the parent site (origin) into the access-allow-origin header of the child site (target).\nMethod-1: Reverse Proxy The first method involves using a reverse proxy router, mapping two sites of the different domain to a different URI of the same domain. For instance we can map \u0026ldquo;www.proxy.com/site-1\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;www.example.com\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;www.proxy.com/site-2\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;www.services.com\u0026rdquo;, and replace the original URL (in the \u0026ldquo;www.example.com\u0026rdquo;) from \u0026ldquo;www.services.com\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;www.proxy.com/site-2\u0026quot;. Then from the point-of-view of the browser, they are now under the same domain hence will not trigger the CORS policy.\nMethod-2: Add Origin Header The second method involves making modification at the service (side of server), in order for the browser to permit CORS access, the receiver will need to have origin\u0026rsquo;s origin in the \u0026ldquo;access-allow-origin\u0026rdquo; header; For instance, \u0026ldquo;www.example.com\u0026rdquo; initiates the request with header \u0026ldquo;origin:www.example.com\u0026rdquo; to server \u0026ldquo;www.service.com\u0026rdquo;, we will need to put header \u0026ldquo;access-allow-origin:www.example.com\u0026rdquo; for every relating request response from \u0026ldquo;www.service.com\u0026rdquo;.\nReference-1: Wikipedia - Cross-origin resource sharing Reference-2: Bilibili - 底搞懂CORS（跨域资源共享 ","permalink":"https://blog.simon-hu.org/posts/2023.11.08-browser-cors-policy-and-csrf-attack/","summary":"Intuition To begin with we need to answer a simple question, why do we need to block traffic from one site to another site, and have everything controlled in this CORS policy ?\nImagine there\u0026rsquo;s two site, site A is a legitimate banking website that provides online finance services, site B is a phishing website that tries to spoof the website A.
