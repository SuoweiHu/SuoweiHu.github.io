      <description>Intuition To begin with, I looked for the definition of &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; in the Google Tag Manager&amp;rsquo;s context, according to their official documentation, they refer tags as &amp;ldquo;segments of code provided by analytics, marketing, and support vendors to help you integrate their product into your website or mobile apps&amp;rdquo;, so bascially you can think of tag like a chunk of script for third party plug-in (like for example: HotJar (a digital expereience insight and behavior analytics tool))</description>

      <description>In this tutorial I will guide you through how to export google analytics data manually on the Google Analytics page
Step-1: open panel exporting from First, proceed to the page you would like to export. For instance in thise example I want to export the &amp;ldquo;all page&amp;rsquo;s views and performances&amp;rdquo;, (located at &amp;ldquo;behavior &amp;gt; site content &amp;gt; all pages&amp;rdquo;).
Step-2: narrow down the records Second, you will need to narrow down the number of records you would like to export via selecting a desired &amp;ldquo;date range&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;row, page&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Step-1 : Google Account Logged-in To begin with, make sure you are logged in the proper google account, we will use the same account for all of the Google related product in the upcoming steps, including &amp;ldquo;Google Analytics&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Google Sheets&amp;rdquo;.
Step-2: Install Add-on Secondly, with the same google account open &amp;ldquo;google sheet&amp;rdquo;, then open &amp;ldquo;extension &amp;gt; add-on &amp;gt; get add-on&amp;quot; and install the google analytics add-on as denoted in the screenshot:</description>

      <description>Intuition I was recently working on a client site, and I got to the issue where the site will show &amp;ldquo;Page unavailable&amp;rdquo; upon login. And upon the suspicion of a mis-placed module or uncleared cache, I wanted to install drush to perform some drush commands.
I ran composer require drush/drush which will install the most recent compatible drush on my current working directory, but then I got this error:

      <description>Intuition To begin with we need to answer a simple question, why do we need to block traffic from one site to another site, and have everything controlled in this CORS policy ?
Imagine there&amp;rsquo;s two site, site A is a legitimate banking website that provides online finance services, site B is a phishing website that tries to spoof the website A. As a developer you might be aware of API&amp;rsquo;s, and the legitimate banking website is using exactly that to transfer money from account to account, for instance: &amp;ldquo;https://bank-site-a.</description>

      <description>Why do &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; want to use vim ? Why not VS Code ? To begin with, I am not quite the typical teenage young boy, he who have not tried; I have been coding for more than 4 years now, and at this point I already have some of the tools of my taste.
If you&amp;rsquo;d ask for my favorite my current pick is &amp;ldquo;VS Code&amp;rdquo;. Why? because I do not code on any particular language (hence no IDE) and I just happen to land on VS Code by accident, if I would first met &amp;ldquo;Sublime&amp;rdquo;, the answer could be different.</description>

      <description>Breakdown of the email address In general a email address is in formatted as username @ domain.com, we can break it down into:
Address after the @ sign, here domain.com, this is the domain of the target mail server, your server will check MX records of this domain from the DNS server, and sends the email to the corresponding IP of the domain. Address before the @ sign, here username, is where the mail receiving server will put your emails at.</description>

This article aims to guide you in resolving this issue effectively.
Solution 1: Rebooting your web development environment Sometimes it will be a easy fix like rebooting your development environment / software, for my instance I am using MAMP, and by stopping the server and opening it again, solved 99% of my issues</description>
