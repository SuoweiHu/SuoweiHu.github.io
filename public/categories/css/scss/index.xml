      <description>TLDR; SCSS is a super-set of CSS
Intuition To begin with, why would a person be interested in this SCSS style-sheet that cannot be directly interpreted by the browser engine, but rather require extra &amp;ldquo;compilation&amp;rdquo; into the CSS style-sheet before use? This is of course because SCSS have some advanced features to CSS, however as time goes, some of the concept from SCSS also gets penetrated and adopted by the CSS standards (For instance: CSS has no nesting feature until 2023 March, CSS has no variables until 2014, for reference SCSS dates back to as far as 2007).</description>
