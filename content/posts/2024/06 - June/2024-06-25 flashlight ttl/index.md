## The break-through that made us all .... unable to do math: TTL Mode

In the previous post, I've explained in a very primitive scenario, where there is an object with infinitely far background, camera's on auto, and flashlight is non-TTL; Without any human intervension to adjust the explosure compensation setting on camera, the camera will over-expose the object. 

And in order to ensure the correct explosure of the object, one will need to adjust the on-camera explosure compensation, and how this can be troublesome in the condition where the object is moving.

However, with the help of <u>**Through-The-Lens** metering</u> (or TTL), you won't have to worry about these configuration
