## Resolution of Error

First get a personal acecss token with the proper privilledge, if you are unsure, select all privilledge:
(your personal access token should look somthing like `glpat-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

Second get into your command-line terminal, log-out then log-back-in with the personal access token created:
```
> docker logout
  Removing login credentials for https://index.docker.io/v1/

> docker login gitlab-registry-production.govcms.amazee.io -u "simon.hu@opc.com.au" -p "glpat-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
  Login Succeeded
```
