## What is Mapbox ?

>   Mapbox GL JS is a client-side JavaScript library for building web maps and web applications with Mapbox's modern mapping technology. You can use Mapbox GL JS to display Mapbox maps in a web browser or client, add user interactivity, and customize the map experience in your application.

**Advantages** comparing to other JavaScript map library:

-   **Support both raster tiles and vector tiles**
-   **Utilize WebGL** (enabling 3D interactivity)
-   **API integration** (with the mapbox tiling service)
-   Compatible with other Mapbox tols

**Disadvantages** comparing to other JavaScript map library:

- **Complexity** (Mapbox GL JS can be more complex to set up and use compared to Leaflet)
- **Cost** (Mapbox GL JS may involve additional costs for heavy usage due to map tile limitations)
- **Community Support** (Leaflet has a larger and more established user community, providing better support and resources)
- **Compatibility** (Mapbox GL JS may have compatibility issues with older browsers due to its modern features)
